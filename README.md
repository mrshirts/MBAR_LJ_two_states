# MBAR_LJ_two_states

In general, this project is focused on predicting expectation values for a different intermolecular potential model given simulation results from an initial reference potential model. 

The Argon directory contains a code that predicts the internal energy, volume, and density for two different potentials.

The Ethane directory contains a code that predicts the internal energy for three different potentials.
