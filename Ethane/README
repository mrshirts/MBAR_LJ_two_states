Ethane_MBAR_two_states is designed to test how well MBAR predicts internal energy for the
Potoff and Mess-UP potentials given simulation results from the TraPPE potential. The 
TraPPE and Mess-UP models represent an example of very good phase space overlap as they
are very similar LJ models. The Potoff model has very poor phase space overlap having a 
different value of sigma and a repulsive exponent of 16. 

In order to test the Mess-UP model you must change the variable assignment on line 69 to "new_state = 2"

The primary conclusion is that for Potoff the number of effective samples is
around 1, which explains the poor prediction for MBAR. However, when using
"MBAR_alt" the prediction is better than "MBAR" and just rerunning the simulation
(i.e. a weighting of 1 for all configurations). The question is, is MBAR or
MBAR_alt the correct implementation of MBAR?

In addition, it is unclear why the prediction of U from MBAR for the Mess-UP 
model is worse than just rerunning the simulation (again, a weighting of 1 for
all configurations). This is surprising as the number of effective samples
is much larger for the Mess-UP model (around 500).
